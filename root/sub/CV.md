####About Me####
----------

Developer with a good knowledge of iOS, OSX and other UNIX systems.
I love to do Applications, Tweaks and CLI programs for iOS and OSX.
I'm active in the iOS jailbreak community, I like to build software that patch iOS (Tweaks) and/or that help me to debug or research. I believe that jailbreak is somewhat necessary to iOS developers because of the amount of tools that help the workflow, like Cycript do for the Debug.
Hundreds of thousands of users enjoy my [Applications](http://mpow.it/Apps) and [Tweaks](http://mpow.it/Tweaks) every day, as a music lover one of the project that I enjoyed more to work on is [MiniPlayer for Mac](http://mpow.it/MiniPlayer-Mac) and [for iOS](http://mpow.it/Tweaks) .
I'm in love with the ObjC runtime. I like to work on challenging projects, do great UI and UX to create the best products possible.  
First of all I'm an iOS Developer, with a really good knowledge of Objective C and Cocoa Touch. I'm able to work fast and writing good, manteinable, scalable and safe code using  modern techniques, the most popular public (and some private) Frameworks of Cocoa Touch, Unit Testing and Continuos Integration. I'm also pretty good debugging code, research and escape from hard situations thanks to my knowledge of the runtime, lldb and other tools like [Cycript](http://cycript.org).  
Some of my open-source projects can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/MP0w](https://github.com/MP0w)
My most known project are in my website [http://MPow.it](http://MPow.it) or on Github.
I actually work for GoodBarber as iOS Developer on the engine of an App Builder and other projects; and I'm even working on a revolutionary Twitter client for iOS in my free time!  
When I'm not writing code I enjoy to play football, do snowboard or surf, listen to music, travel, live somewhere in the world and have fun with friends.

####Projects####

#####iOS and OSX#####

- [MiniPlayer for iOS](http://mpow.it/Tweaks) and [MiniPlayer for Mac](http://mpow.it/MiniPlayer-Mac) an Application that lets you control and search your Music with all the most popular Apps and Music Services. It supports iTunes, Spotify, Rdio and is extensible to any other Application you like with Plug-Ins, the UI is made by the popular Designer [@Surenix](http://twitter.com/surenix). Is probably my most famous personal project, many famous blogs talked about it: iDownloadblog, CNET, lifehacker and many others. 
- [My GoodBarber](http://mpow.it/Apps) An App to manage your GoodBarber Applications directly on your device. Send push, see statistics, test your Application directly inside this App and ask question to the support. Is a really challenging project because this application is able to [run sub-applicantions](https://twitter.com/ManzoPower/status/489423498209918976/photo/1) that are built with the GoodBarber App engine.
- [My WMaker](http://mpow.it/Apps) an App to manage your WMaker Websites. As any respectable app for CMS this app let you create or edit your Articles, manage the comments, contact the support and see the statistic of your websites.
- Some little applications done for hackathons are on my [Github](https://github.com/MP0w); [Refuel](https://github.com/MP0w/h4c) is the last one, has been presented in Ajaccio (Corse) and than is Turin(Italy) along with the other winners of hack4med in various European cointries.
- [MPPlot](https://github.com/MP0w/MPPlot) a Plot Library written in native Objective C born with Refuel in the hackathon hack4corsica. Is my most successful opensource project but is in good company ([MPSkewed](https://github.com/MP0w/MPSkewed),[MPParallaxCollection](https://github.com/MP0w/MPParallaxCollection)).
- [Curious](https://github.com/MP0w/Curious) this opensource project is one of my favourites, it heavily use the Objective C runtime to allow curious people inspect iOS. You can inspect the hierarchy of the Applications (or the SpringBoard) and the methods available on objects as well as call them. I worked on it in my free time and is not finished yet but since [Flipboard did something similar](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX) I'm not sure I will ever finish it.
- Many Mobile Substrate [Tweaks for iPhone Jailbroken](http://mpow.it/Tweaks) (more than 1.000.000 Download and 500.000 uniques devices) some of them are free and opensource
- [CannibalKiwi](http://mpow.it/Apps) a game done just for fun and to learn the framework Cocos2D.
- Other Applications and CLI utilities some can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/MP0w)



#####Web#####

- [My website and Blog](http://mpow.it) based on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - [opensource and hosted on github](https://github.com/MP0w/MP0w.github.io)  
- Website to collect and track the stats of my Applications and beta repository for my Tweaks (SQL / PHP / HTML 5 / CSS 3) [http://mpow.it/repo](http://mpow.it/repo)
- Webapp to manage fantasy soccer with my friends [http://mpow.it/fanta](http://mpow.it/fanta) (SQL / PHP / HTM 5 / CSS 3 / BootStrap / Library for JS Graphs)
- SpottedWorld (WebApp/Social Network) was a Spotted based on Geo-localisation that even showed the most famous Spotted Pages on Facebook near you [Dead because of money - http://spottedworld.net] (SQL / PHP / HTML5 / CSS3)
- Other websites for clients and for the restaurants of my family.
