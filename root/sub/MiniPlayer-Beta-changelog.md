---------------

- iOS 8 Support
- Added @3x icons
- Fixed some crashes
- libobjcipc (from @tweakcc) is not yet compatible with iOS 8, I'm working on it and **a version that at least doesn't crash** is in my repo and will be installed with MiniPlayer

###Known Issues###
-----------

- Settings may not work properly (settings are written after some time)
- Play in spotify may not work due to libobjcipc problems on iOS 8
