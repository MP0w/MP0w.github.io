I'm an iOS Engineer but I like any kind of Cocoa, born in 1991 and "Made in Italy".  
I grew up in the iOS Jailbreak scene breaking stuff, exploring and learning.  
I'm interested in software architecture, focused on quality and love great UI/UX.  
I like to work in agile environments, constantly learning and sharing knowledge.

In 2011 I received an iPhone 3GS from my parents, I was in love with it except it lacked a simple but BIG feature: Wallpapers. You could only have a black background. I started to look for ways to workaround this limitation and I discovered the Jailbreak.  
From there I started to learn coding, research how iOS and its frameworks are working internally and build and publish my own tweaks (http://mpow.it/Tweaks), it was a lot of fun, had quite good success and it quickly ended up becoming my job!
