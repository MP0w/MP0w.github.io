Iâ€™m an Italian Developer, 24 years old. Most of my works have something to do with Apple products, I'm an **iOS Developer** but I like any kind of Cocoa.
I'm into Jailbreak for tweak development, to break stuff, explore and learn.
I love great **UI / UX** and enjoy to work on **challenging projects**.
Swift is the future.
Currently working at [@Runtastic](https://twitter.com/Runtastic) in Linz (Austria).
