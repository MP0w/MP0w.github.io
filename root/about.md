I'm an Italian **Developer**, 23 years old that loves iOS and OSX.
Most of my works have something to do with Apple products, I like **Objective C** and play with his runtime.  Sometimes I like to make jailbreak tweaks to **escape from Apple** rules, **break something**, **explore** and **learn**.
I love great **UI and UX**; I always try to do something that is outstanding and I try to exit from the schemes.  
I enjoy to work on **challenging projects** or unusual stuff.  
I like to make **open-source** controls, take a look at my [Github](http://github.com/MP0w).  
I'm currently working at [@Runtastic](https://twitter.com/Runtastic) in Linz (Austria).
