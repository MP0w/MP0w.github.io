  <div class="about">
    <p>
      Born in 1991 and “Made in Italy”. I grew up in the iOS Jailbreak scene breaking stuff, exploring and learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2011 I received an iPhone 3GS from my parents, I was in love with it except it lacked a simple but BIG feature: Wallpapers. You could only have a black background. I started to look for ways to workaround this limitation and I discovered the Jailbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there I started to learn C and Objective-C, research how iOS and its frameworks are working internally and build and publish my own tweaks, it was a lot of fun, had quite good success and it quickly ended up becoming my job!
    </p>
    <p>
      These days I do a bit of whatever is needed, mobile, web, backend and engineering leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m motivated by technical challenges and software architecture. I'm focused on quality and love great UI/UX.

      I'm interested in web3 and blockchains, mostly ethereum, not the scammy part: 99% of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, etc.... those are <a href="https://twitter.com/ManzoPower/status/1544083765915435014">the equivalent of beer apps at the beginning of the App store</a>
