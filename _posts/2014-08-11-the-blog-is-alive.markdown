After be inactive for years I completely rewritten my blog and my website.
I never used so much my previous WordPress based blog, **2 articles in >2 years fill my inbox of spam**. I didn't like to use a CMS and it's plug-ins, it was not for me.
Even my **website was inactive** and never updated, I used it just for internal stuff, stats managment 
or backends of Applications.  

Recently I was really curious about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I decided to try it. I will not write a guide for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) because [Google is full of these](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jekyll), I will just say that it was really funny to `code` my website and this blog from scratch and it's an incredible *Developer oriented* tool.

I hope I will find the time to update this blog constantly since it's really fast to create articles and mantain the website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Github Pages](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  
I guess I will write for the most part Tech posts, relative to iOS/OSX Development; the first one will be about ***Percent Driven Transitions and Animations with UIKit***, something that can be usefull for *Developers* but even for *UI/UX Designers*. Subscribe to the RSS (see the footer) if you may be interested.

Last but not least, all this website is [Open Source and hosted by Github](https://github.com/MP0w/MP0w.github.io)
