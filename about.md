I'm an italian Developer, 22 years old that loves iOS and OSX.  
Most of my works have something to do with Apple products, I like Objective C and play with his runtime,  sometimes I do something inside the jailbreak comunity.  
I love great UI and UX; I always try to do something that is outstanding and I try to exit from the schemes.  
What I prefer is to work in stuff that is not usual.  
ATM I'm working at [GoodBarber](http://goodbarber.com) in Corse.
