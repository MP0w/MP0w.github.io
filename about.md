I'm an Italian **Developer**, 22 years old that loves iOS and OSX.
Most of my works have something to do with Apple products, I like **Objective C** and play with his runtime.  Sometimes I like to make jailbreak tweaks to **escape from Apple** rules, **break something**, **explore** and **learn**.
I love great **UI and UX**; I always try to do something that is outstanding and I try to exit from the schemes.  
I enjoy to work on **challenging projects** and stuff that is not usual.  
I like to make **open-source** controls, sometimes I'm inspired from existing cool Applcations, other times by my dreams; take a look at my [Github](http://github.com/MP0w).  
ATM I'm working at [GoodBarber](http://goodbarber.com) in Corse.
