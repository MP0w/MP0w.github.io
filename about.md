I'm an Italian **Developer**, 22 years old that loves iOS and OSX.
Most of my works have something to do with Apple products, I like **Objective C** and play with his runtime.  Sometimes I like to make jailbreak tweaks to **escape from Apple** rules, **break something**, **explore** and **learn**.
I love great UI and UX; I always try to do something that is outstanding and I try to exit from the schemes.  
I enjoy to work on challenging projects and stuff that is not usual.
ATM I'm working at [GoodBarber](http://goodbarber.com) in Corse.
